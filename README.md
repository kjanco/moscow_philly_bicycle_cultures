This was my final project for COMM381 at UPenn's Annenberg school in the fall of 2019, my last semester. I decided to look at bicycle cultures in Moscow and Philadelphia, and to compare the two. data contains all the data I used in my project, data_analysis contains all my work of data cleaning and analyses, and data_presentation contains my final data article. Please consult the README files in each individual folder. The only file name inconsistencies are two files I needed to zip up, so the only difference is that they have .zip at the end of them. Thank you for taking a look at this, and I hope you learn something!
